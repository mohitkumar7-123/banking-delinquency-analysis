## Project Overview

A comprehensive data analytics project for predicting customer delinquency risk in banking operations. This project demonstrates advanced SQL analysis, Python data science skills, and adherence to the key points framework.

---

## ✅ Key Points Coverage

### 1. Business Problem ✅
**Documented extensively in README.md:**
- Banks face significant financial losses due to payment delinquencies
- Early identification of high-risk customers is crucial
- Need for data-driven risk assessment framework
- Goals: Minimize credit losses, optimize collections, improve cash flow

### 2. EDA Methodology ✅
**Comprehensive approach documented:**
- Data Quality Assessment
- Customer Profiling (demographics, financial health, credit behavior)
- Risk Factor Analysis with weighted scoring
- Statistical Analysis and correlation studies
- Payment pattern trends over 6 months

**Implementation:**
- SQL queries in `sql/risk_analysis.sql`
- Python analysis in `python/eda_analysis.py`
- Data dictionary in `docs/data_dictionary.md`

### 3. Insight Generation ✅
**Multiple levels of insights:**

**Risk Segmentation:**
- HIGH RISK: ≥70% probability
- MEDIUM RISK: 30-69% probability  
- LOW RISK: <30% probability

**Critical Risk Indicators:**
- Missed Payments (≥3): Very High Impact
- Credit Utilization (>70%): High Impact
- Low Credit Score (<500): High Impact
- High DTI Ratio (>40%): Medium Impact

**Payment Pattern Insights:**
- Recent behavior weighted more heavily
- Progressive decline patterns identified
- Consistency is key predictor

**Demographic Insights:**
- Income impact analysis
- Employment status correlation
- Geographic risk distribution
- Age factor analysis

### 4. Conclusion & Recommendations ✅
**Strategic recommendations provided:**

**Proactive Risk Monitoring:**
- Real-time payment tracking
- Automated alerts for early warnings
- Predictive models for 2-3 month advance notice

**Tiered Collection Strategy:**
- HIGH RISK: Immediate intervention, personal contact
- MEDIUM RISK: Proactive outreach, payment flexibility
- LOW RISK: Standard reminders, relationship building

**Credit Policy Optimization:**
- Tighten underwriting for high-risk segments
- Dynamic credit limit adjustments
- Graduated credit increases
- Enhanced verification requirements

**Customer Engagement:**
- Financial literacy programs
- Hardship assistance programs
- Loyalty incentives
- Early intervention counseling

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 20-30% reduction in delinquency rates
- 15-25% improvement in collection efficiency
- 10-15% decrease in write-offs
- Enhanced customer satisfaction
